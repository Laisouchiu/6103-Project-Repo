# 6103-Project-Repo

We are analyzing a selling record dataset from the New York City property market, which includes 
annual selling records of single buildings or unit buildings from 2016 to 2017.

## The research topic
Any property's sales price depends on various factors like location, area, neighborhood, and others. 
In this dataset, we are analyzing the different factors present in our dataset to predict the sales price 
of the building in New York City. The aim of this project is to find relations and patterns of sales 
price w.r.t. various other factors to have a clear understanding of property price in NYC.

## The SMART Questions
* What type(s) of location variable(s) (Eg. block, borough, neighborhood) will affect the 
selling price most?
* How is the sale price of commercial property different from the sale price of residential 
property?
* How is accuracy different if different machine learning models like linear regression, 
logistic regression, and random forest are applied?
